## 🎯 How to Succeed

### 1. Set Realistic Expectations

This course is **intense**. It's designed for senior engineers who want **mastery**, not beginners who want an introduction.

**Recommended Pace**:
- Part-time (10 hrs/week): 4-6 months
- Full-time (40 hrs/week): 4-6 weeks
- Intensive (60+ hrs/week): 2-3 weeks

### 2. Don't Skip the Fundamentals

Module 1 is **critical**. Everything builds on those mental models.

If you skip Module 1, you'll struggle with:
- Why certain patterns exist
- Performance implications of decisions
- How React Server Components work
- Concurrent rendering behavior

### 3. Do the Exercises

Reading lectures ≠ understanding. **Building** ≠ understanding deeply.

The exercises force you to:
- Apply concepts hands-on
- Encounter edge cases
- Build intuition through practice

**Pro tip**: Try exercises before looking at solutions.

### 4. Build Real Projects

After each module, build something **real** with the concepts:

- Module 1: Analyze a real app's performance with React DevTools
- Module 2: Type an existing project with strict TypeScript
- Module 3: Build a blog with Next.js App Router
- Module 5: Optimize a slow dashboard
- Module 7: Build a mobile app feature

### 5. Join the Community

Learning is better with others:
- Share your progress
- Ask questions
- Help others
- Get feedback on your code

**Where to connect**:
- React Discord
- Next.js Discord
- Expo Discord
- Reddit (r/reactjs, r/nextjs)
- Twitter/X (#ReactJS)
